ðŸŒ± Building control planes for two different prototypes. One using microservices deployed on Kubernetes and one with a mono-repo with microservices deployed via a cli on a base SLES image via daemons.

âš¡ Fun fact: My dog loves to catch frisbees! Apparently that's a thing for pitbull mixes. Also, this one wears his heart on his puppy-sleeves and lives for cuddles.
