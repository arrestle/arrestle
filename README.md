 <img src="angrypotato.png" alt="logo" width="30" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>  In December 2024, I started as a **Principal Software Engineer** at **Red Hat**. Onboarded into the **Ansible Controllert** team for first three months. Now permanently assigned to the new **Ansible Inframesh** team integrating with all things Hashicorp in Golang on Linux. Living the dream!

💼 In September 2024, I concluded my role as a Principal Software Engineer at Dell Technologies. This position included:

- 🌱 Building control planes for two different prototypes. One using microservices deployed on Kubernetes and one with a mono-repo with microservices. Learned how to monitor complex hardware/software systems using Open Telemetry.

- 🌱 Led a six-person team to become finalists in the 2023 ISG (Infrastructure Services Group) Hackathon with a solar-powered edge computing proposal.

📚 I earned a Master’s in Liberal Studies, specializing in Computer Science, Innovation, and Sustainability, from NCSU in May 2023. Previously I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science with a minor in biology from UMaine.

⚡ Fun fact: My dog loves to swim, run on trails, and even catch frisbees! Logan is a pitbull mix, but he gets bossed around by the cat, wears his heart on his puppy-sleeves and lives for cuddles.
