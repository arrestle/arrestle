### Hi there 👋

🔭 I graduated in May, 2023 from NCSU with a Master's in Liberal Studies specializing in Computer Science, Innovation, ans Sustainability. I now work at Dell Technologies as a Principal Software Engineer. 

🌱 I’m currently learning how to monitor complex hardware/software systems using Open Telemetry.

😄 Pronouns: she/her/code-freak

⚡ Fun fact: My dog loves to catch frisbees! Apparently that's a thing for pitbull mixes. Also, this one wears his heart on his puppy-sleeves and lives for cuddles.
